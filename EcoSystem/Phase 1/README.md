# Ecosystem

If movers (center circle that's circled by larger hollow circles) overlap more orbiters (hollow circles) spawn + movers turn red


## Ideas
turns red = infected
after a certain amount of time the infected "die"/disappear
infected attracted to healthy

healthy = blue/green/purple
mate

Hierarchy b/t blues/greens/purples?
